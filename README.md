# ctwstatsjs
A CTW Stats Discord bot in javascript (heavily inspired by ccev and qej: https://github.com/ccev/ctwstats) 

### Setup
It's quite easy. Just go to config.json and put your discord bot token, hypixel api token and whatever prefix you'd like. The node modules I've installed are: `got and mojangjs`. The utilll.js is a file I got from another developer just to use the isValidNickname function.
